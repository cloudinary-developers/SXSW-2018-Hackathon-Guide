## Build Styled Cover Art and Fan Pages

Use style transfer to generate [neural artwork from images](/presentation-and-responsive-image-delivery/turn-photos-to-art-with-style-transfer.md) using artist-branded graphics: process fan photos and venue snapshots captured at artist events into amazing cover art and fan pages.

Let users compete in fan-boy \| fan-girl  [image art contest](https://faas-cloudinary.com/wt-60a287cd40c53f6e56bd60ac8922bc3e-0/style-transfer).  Feel free to [fork our project](/functions-as-a-service/build-an-online-contest.md) and take it up a notch by adding social media sharing and other features.

### Choose a Serverless Stack

Resist the urge to create an express app and deploy a server for this one!  Instead focus on using each API directly within a Single Page App \(SPA\) to take advantage of the responsive design possibilities.

Cloudinary's APIs work extremely well with Auth0 [Webtasks](https://webtask.io) and other serverless platforms.  We support many languages, including JavaScript and [Node.js](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration).

### Use This Guide to Get Started

We've organized the Cloudinary resources in this guide by functionality so you can quickly add a feature to your application. Each article is a short and concise walkthrough, so you won't have to comb too deep through our extensive [documentation](https://cloudinary.com/documentation), unless you want to.

### Tweet/Share your Experience

We know your Hackathon experience will be fun and engaging.  Don't forget to share that with your friends on social media.   _**In fact, we've added links at the top of this guide to make sharing easy.**_ Learning about visualizing an audio waveform? Show the world what you are working on and let them learn about the technologies right along with you.
