The SXSW Hackathon (formerly the SXSW Music Hackathon) is 24 straight hours of buzzing, high-tech creativity as music, VR/AR, and film hacker/creators use their programming knowledge and our collection of music, visual APIs, and coding assets to develop their industry-changing prototypes and compete for cash prizes, awarded by our panel of celebrity judges.

We're hackers too, so we know your time at the hackathon is limited. That's why we've developed this guide to help you harness our technology to realize your ideas in the most efficient way possible.

###Challenge:

**Prizes:**

* 1-year _Cloudinary Plus_ plan \($1068 value\) award to the hack team chosen as _best use of Cloudinary API_.
* The most creative hack projects (that make use of Cloudinary API) will be featured on our Blog.
